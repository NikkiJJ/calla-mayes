        It’s easy to find ourselves moving through the days on autopilot,
        feeling disconnected or unmotivated in our relationships, work,
        or sense of self.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, we can explore what truly matters to you, and move towards
        a life that feels more authentic and fulfilling for you.

        As an integrative psychotherapeutic counsellor, I draw on a range of
        approaches — mainly CBT, psychodynamic, and person-centred
        therapy — to meet your individual needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This allows our work together to be flexible and personalised to your
        unique experiences and goals.

          It’s important to find the right counsellor for you, so I offer an
          initial session at a reduced rate. This gives us a chance to meet,
          explore what brings you to therapy, and see how we might work
          together to support the changes you hope to make.

      <p>
        As you process pain and difficult thoughts that may lead to feelings of
        anxiety, depression or low self-worth. Together, we can build your
        confidence, strengthen your ability to regulate emotions and develop
        healthy boundaries. This can allow for deeper connection with yourself
        and for positive changes in your relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        My aim is to offer a calm, safe, and non-judgemental space where you can
        be fully yourself.
